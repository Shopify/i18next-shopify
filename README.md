# `@shopify/i18next-shopify`

This package is an `i18nFormat` plugin for the [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) library. It allows developers to use the same format used by Shopify [apps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/checkout/best-practices/localizing-ui-extensions#how-it-works) and [themes](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture/locales/storefront-locale-files#usage) for localization.

Key features include:
* String interpolation with both single `{}` and double `{{}}` curly brace mustache formats
* Pluralization as nested keys
  * E.g. `{"keyWithCount": {"one": "value"}}` instead of `{"keyWithCount_one": "value"}`
* Ordinal pluralization using the interpolation variable `ordinal` as number (e.g. `t("key", { ordinal: 1 })`) or using the interpolation variable `ordinal` as boolean and `count` as number (e.g. `t("key", { ordinal: true, count: 1 })`)
  * NOTE: When `ordinal` is explicitly set to `0` and `count` is also explicitly set, the plugin will treat this as cardinal pluralization (e.g. `t("key", { count: 1, ordinal: 0 }`))

## Getting started

### Add the package
```
$ npm install @shopify/i18next-shopify
```
or
```
$ yarn add @shopify/i18next-shopify
```

### Configure i18next to use this plugin

> **Warning**
> The [`Intl.PluralRules` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/PluralRules) is required for this plugin's plural handling.
> If your target environments do not support this API, you may need to [polyfill](https://github.com/eemeli/intl-pluralrules) it.
> This plugin's plural handling is not compatible with i18next's fallback to JSON format v3 plural handling.

```js
import i18next from "i18next";
import ShopifyFormat from "@shopify/i18next-shopify";

i18next.use(ShopifyFormat).init(i18nextOptions);
```

## Example

```js
import i18next from "i18next";
import ShopifyFormat from "@shopify/i18next-shopify";

i18next.use(ShopifyFormat).init({
  lng: "en",
  resources: {
    en: {
      translation: {
        hello: "Hello {{casual_name}}!",
        products: {
          "0": "I have no products.",
          "1": "I have a single product.",
          one: "I have {{count}} product.",
          other: "I have {{count}} products.",
        },
      },
    }
  }
});

i18next.t("hello", { casual_name: "Shopify" }); // -> Hello Shopify!
i18next.t("products", { count: 2 }); // -> I have 2 products!
